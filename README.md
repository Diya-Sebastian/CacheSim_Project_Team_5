## Objective of the Project

The main objective of this project is to simulate cache memory behavior through software logic.  
It helps in understanding how memory blocks are stored, accessed, and replaced in cache memory.

## Concepts Covered

- Cache Mapping Techniques  
  - Direct Mapping  
  - Set-Associative Mapping  

- Cache Replacement Policies  
  - FIFO  
  - LRU  
  - LFU  

- Cache Performance Evaluation  
  - Hit Count  
  - Miss Count  
  - Hit Ratio

 ## Functionality

- Accepts user-defined cache size
- Takes memory block reference sequence as input
- Displays cache status after each memory access
- Calculates total hits, misses, and hit ratio
