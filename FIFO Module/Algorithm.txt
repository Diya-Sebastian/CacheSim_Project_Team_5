Algorithm 

Step 1: Start 

Step 2: Initialize the cache 
    Create an empty list cache to store blocks 
    Initialize hits = 0 and misses = 0 

Step 3: Take user input 
    Ask user for cache_size (positive integer) 
    Ask user for memory references (comma-separated integers) 
    Validate inputs to ensure correctness 

Step 4: For each memory reference in the sequence: 
    Check if the block is already in cache 

    If yes: 
    Increment hits by 1 
    Print “HIT” and current cache content 

    If no: 
    Increment misses by 1 

    If cache is full: 
    Remove the first (oldest) block from the cache 
    Print which block was evicted 

    Add the current block to the end of the cache 
    Print “MISS” and updated cache content 

Step 5: After processing all references: 
    Display the final cache state 
    Display total hits 
    Display total misses 
    Calculate and display hit ratio = hits / total_references 

Step 6: End
