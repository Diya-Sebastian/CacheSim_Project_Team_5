Algorithm: LRU Cache Simulation


Step 1: Start

Step 2: Read the cache size

        Input the maximum number of blocks the cache can hold.

Step 3: Read the reference string

        Input a sequence of block numbers separated by spaces.

Step 4: Initialize the LRU Cache

        Create an empty list to represent the cache.

        Set the cache capacity to the given size.

Step 5: For each block in the reference string, do the following:

    Step 5.1: Check for Cache HIT

        If the block is already present in the cache:

        Remove the block from its current position.

        Insert the block at the end of the cache (marking it as most recently used).

        Display HIT and the current cache contents.

    Step 5.2: Handle Cache MISS

        If the block is not present in the cache:

        Check whether the cache is full.

        If full:

        Remove the first block from the cache (least recently used block).

        Display the evicted block.

        Insert the new block at the end of the cache.

        Display MISS and the updated cache contents.

Step 6: Repeat Step 5 until all blocks are processed

Step 7: Stop
